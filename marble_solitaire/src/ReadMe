Some changes I made to my existing MarbleSolitaireModelImpl include:

- changing the access modifier of the fields, "armThickness" and "gameBoard",
 and helper methods, "calcBoardLength", "calcBoardCenter", "updateBoard", "canStillMakeMoves",
 and "isNextToMarble" to be protected instead of private so that subclasses have access to them.
 - for some of the methods in the base class, I shortened, combined, or replace code for it to
 run more smoothly, be more efficient and be more easily readable.
 - I used the helper method "calcBoardLength" a lot in the methods of the base class but
 this formula is not applicable for triangle shapes, only for the european and english boards.
 Therefore, i went in and replaced the parts where I used that helper and replaced it with
 the preexisting method that comes along with 2D arrays in Java "length", which simply returns
 the length of the board, without using the armthickness or dimension.
