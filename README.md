# marble_solitaire

The game starts with all 36 marbles outside of the field, leaving the empty hole in the middle of the board. 
To play, simply jump one marble over another and place it into the tray. 
Continue jumping over the marbles until there is only one marble on the field. 
If you end up with more than one marble, you lose.

At the end of the game for my program, the screen displays whether the user has won or lost and how many marbles were left on the board.

My program comes with the English setup of marble solitaire (cross shape) as well as two other style: the European setup (octogonal shape) and the Triangle setup (triangle shape)
